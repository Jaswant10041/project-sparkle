    The Project Sparkle WebPage is a simple web application built using React.
    It allows users to submit bug reports by entering a title, description, and selecting the severity level (Low, Medium, High).
    Submitted reports are displayed in a clean, card-style layout.
    This project demonstrates the use of React Context API for state management, component-based architecture, and Tailwind CSS for basic styling.
